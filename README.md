🚀 Major Update: Advanced Remote Management & Deployment System
This update focuses on infrastructure scalability, stealth persistence, and enhanced exploitation capabilities.

🖥️ Multi-Server & UI Infrastructure
Simultaneous Multi-Server Management: The dashboard now supports connecting and building applications across different servers at the same time.
Centralized Identity: Clients must use a unified account email across all servers.
Host List Management: Server IPs must be added to the APK Maker > Host List (Last page).
Security Warning: The "Export" function for the server list contains raw configuration data. Do not share the exported file.


🛠️ New Exploitation & Network Tools
DDOS Attacker: Integrated support for 7 attack vectors, capable of leveraging single or multiple client nodes.
Remote SSH/TELNET: Advanced terminal access for network devices (e.g., routers at 192.168.1.1). Allows for DNS manipulation, IP filtering, and traffic redirection.
Silent XMR Miner: A background Monero (XMR) mining utility for resource utilization.
File Manager Pro: Added a remote "Download from URL" feature directly within the file system manager.


📱 Stealth, Persistence & Monitoring
Enhanced Live Screen: Full support for screen rotation with an added Screen Block feature for total control.
Persistence via Screen Saver: The app now registers as the Default Screen Saver to maintain a persistent background process and prevent OS killing.
Call/SMS Interception: When set as the default SMS/Call app, it provides full panel control to hide or block all incoming/outgoing communication.
Pin Grabber Mode: A specialized tracking mode that records PIN entries on specific, user-selected applications.
Auto-Resume Protocol: Automated reconnection for high-priority streams: Files, Camera, Screen, Microphone, and Keylogger.


🏗️ Advanced APK Builder & Dropper Mechanics
Plugin/Dropper Mode: Use legitimate Play Store apps as carriers.
Customizable Dialogs: Replaced standard Google Play prompts with fully customizable title/message dialogs.

Security & Obfuscation:
Updated to the latest APKEditor core.
Integrated Custom Protection to mitigate Accessibility Service detection.
Optional encryption for the main APK within the dropper assets.
Optimization: Reduced CPU overhead to minimize thermal throttling, though battery consumption remains high for 24/7 uptime.


🔍 Refined Keylogger & ADB Tools
Advanced Keylogging: Now features action filtering, search functionality, and a modernized layout.
BTMOB Integration: Quick APK deployment via ADB with a wide range of customizable installation parameters.

⚠️ Technical Note: If "Protect APK" is disabled and Google Play prompts to "Scan this app," selecting "Scan" will execute the bypass logic.
